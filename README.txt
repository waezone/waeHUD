I have used Familiar Bold font, and Planet Estyle fonts in this HUD, all credit goes to the creators of it.

Fog's custom Crosshairs have been installed on this HUD, presets have been made for Konr Wings and ThinCircle crosshairs.

Exctract all files into a folder named waeHUD into the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom" directory.

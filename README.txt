waeHUD version 1.0 Initial release.

This HUD is the first one made by me, give me feedback on what I should do next/fix on the HUD

This HUD is in early development  so most features will not be changed.
Also give me suggestion while im in the development of this HUD.

NOTE: Currently only 19:9 resolutions are compatable.


I used CoughyMachine font, Planet Estyle font, and Mentone fonts in this HUD, all credit goes to the creators of it.

Fog's custom Crosshairs have been installed on this HUD, presets have been made for Konr Wings and ThinCircle crosshairs.


//////To Install\\\\\\
Exctract all files into a folder named waeHUD into the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom" directory.
Be sure to remove all existing HUDs from the custom folder.

To change to the ThinCircle crosshair go to scripts\hudlayout.res and scroll to the bottom and change Konr Wings to "visible"	"0" and the ThinCircle to "visible"	"1"
